FT_solve_big
Current working mode:

Calculate Index and chunks
find chunks and push to b
solve 3 r
solve 3 l
ft_push_value
find spot in stack
    rotate, push
    spot in stack =
        next index is bigger
        last index is smaller
        distance from bottom
        distance from top
    special case first:
        if index lst->content->index is bigger then index
        and
